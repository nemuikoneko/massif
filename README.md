# Massif - Curated, indexed content for foreign language learners

Massif is an umbrella project that contains a few different threads of work related to helping people learn foreign languages by **curating and indexing authentic foreign language content**.

## Background

I generally subscribe to the [input hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Input_hypothesis) and have personally had success learning Japanese with a study method based on media immersion and sentence mining into [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/) (similar to the [Refold](https://refold.la/) approach). But despite the abundance of tools available, the study process still has some conspicuous pain points, including:

* **Clunky sentence mining and card creation**: Even with the latest tools (which usually involve a lot of setup), mining sentences into Anki is clunky.
* **Mined sentences are of mixed quality**: Most sentences you encounter in immersion don't make for great sentence cards, for a variety of reasons. High quality sentences are worth their weight in gold.
* **Sentence cards don't age well**: Sentence cards tend to become less effective as their intervals grow larger, because you end up memorizing the context too much. In theory, once a have a word seeded in memory, it should mostly get reinforced by immersion (not just SRS), but this is still somewhat of an issue.
* **Difficulty finding incremental content**: For beginner/intermediate learners, it can be hard to find content that is at the right level of diffculty. One needs to learn to power through this to some extent, but it still could be improved.
* **Toolchain complexity**: Existing "all in one" products fail to encompass the whole process, so learners following this approach end up having to piece together a complicated chain of tools to get the job done. This allows for a lot of flexibility and customization, but excludes less tech-savvy learners and people who are curious to try the methods with less commitment.
